# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator that i made in SLU during my freshman year 2019 to 2020

This was made during my freshman year in Saint Louis University in 3/11/2020

FAQ's:
What can your calculator do?
- My calculator can do a lot of things, it's a hybrid of a normal calculator and a scientific calculator. But the real question is
  what are the limitations of it.

  Limitations of my calculator starts with incomplete functions that can be found in a normal Scientific Calculator. This calculator
  can only provide you the basic operations in order to compute a function in a PEMDAS way.
  
How did you created the Algorithm for the Computations?
- As much as i enjoyed creating this program, the algorithm wasn't made by me. The algorithm that i used was the Shunting Yard Algorithm
  of Dijkstra. Where you input a series which is an infix and converts it into a postfix form that can be easily computed without worrying
  about the violation in PEMDAS rule.
  
Where did you learn this Algorithm?
- A simple google search will teach you many things.
